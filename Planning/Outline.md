# Building Blocks of Blockchain
The goal of this camp is to demystify blockchain and the various programs built on top of it. Students will learn about the relationships between blockchain, cryptocurrency, NFTS, and other applications of the technology. Ultimately, students should come away from this camp with a better idea of what blockchain actually is, and how it can be applied to real-world problems.

## Icebreaker
Start with an icebreaker activity where the students can get to know each other. One idea is to ask random questions - go around the room and have each student answer one question at random, such as:

- What would you do with a million dollars?
- What is your dream job?
- What is your dream vacation destination?
- What is your favorite movie/tv show?

## Lecture
The lecture should intrigue the students, provide them some background information, and make sure they have an idea of what blockchain really is at its core.

### Introduction
Start by discussing things they may have heard about (cryptocurrency/NFTs).

- Ups and Downs of investing in crypto (volatility)
- Power of NFTs for good or evil
- Emphasize that blockchain is a tool, and not a panacea
  - "...\[T\]echnology is neither inherently helpful nor harmful. It is simply a tool... \[T\]he real effects of technology depend upon how it is wielded. It can be used to inspire and catalyze change just as easily as it can be used in ways that are detrimental to society." - https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/06/30/tech-is-just-a-tool/

### History
Go over the origins of blockchain and how it has developed.

- Bitcoin whitepaper
- Impact (Intended/Potential/Actual)
- Gartner Hype Cycle - https://www.diamandis.com/hubfs/IMG_0006.png


### Actual Technology
Get into the actual tech of blockchain upon which everything is built.

- General Explanation
- Interactive Demo - https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/
- Ethereum
- Smart Contracts

### Real World Examples
Discuss some real world examples of blockchain applications that have an impact on the real world.

## Formative Assessment / Discussion
A quiz to test knowledge retention from the lecture - also including some poll questions to spark discussions.

## Code-Along
An interactive activity where students can play around with Solidity in a sandbox environment.

- MetaMask installation/configuration
- Replit for writing/hosting smart contracts
- Students should get some starter code and modify it
- Resource: https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/33-escrow-contract-with-solidity

## Self-Paced Work
Give students a chance to explore more on their own - provide some guidance and additional instruction for them to follow.

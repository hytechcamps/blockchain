# Blockchain Lecture Script
Follow this script when presenting the [Blockchain PowerPoint Presentation](Blockchain.pptx). Each slide has its own section below. Animations and transitions are designated with `<click>` markers. Questions to ask the students are bolded. When asking questions, try to make sure that a variety of students are answering - use cold calling if needed.

Note that **Slides 11, 12, 13, and 16** are hidden. Also, **Slide 18** involves a demo hosted on a separate website. The script indicates how to interact with the demo.

## Slide 1
Hello, and welcome to the Building Blocks of Blockchain Hy-Tech Camp presentation! `<click>`

## Slide 2
To start, let's find out what you already know. **Raise your hand if you've heard of blockchain.** Zoom participants can send a "yes" or "no" in the chat. **Now, raise your hand if you've heard of bitcoin, crypto, or NFTs**. **Can anyone tell me what any of those things are?** Interesting! We're going to get into all of it. `<click>`

- Bitcoin is a Cryptocurrency – you might have heard about it as an investment. `<click>`
- **Does anyone recognize this shiba inu dog?** Some of you? It is a meme, and also the mascot of a memecoin called Dogecoin.
- How about this... **Does anyone know the name of the stadium where the LA Lakers play?** `<click>` Well, they _used to_ play at Staples Center, but the name recently changed to crypto.com arena. `<click>`
- You may have seen this Matt Damon Super Bowl ad for the same company - it's a cryptocurrency exchange. `<click>`
- Maybe you've seen this FTX ad featuring 4-time NBA champion Steph Curry – or maybe you recognize the ice sculpture he's building. `<click>`
- You may have seen pictures like this pixelated person – these are NFTs, basically digital assets than can be owned and traded. `<click>`
- Another example of NFTs is NBA Top Shot – basically virtual trading cards.

So, these blockchain-based things are actually all over our culture now... but what _is_ blockchain? We're going to find out! `<click>`

## Slide 3
`<click>` A blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger for recording transactions and tracking assets. Try to remember the keywords "distributed" and "immutable." `<click>` Blockchain is the technology behind NFTs, crypto, and more. `<click>` It was popularized with bitcoin (which we will discuss soon), but there is also a lot more it can do! `<click>`

## Slide 4
Before getting to the more advanced stuff, let's take a step back and talk about the history of blockchain. `<click>`

## Slide 5
`<click>` This is a rough timeline of the history of Blockchain. We'll talk a bit more about some of these, but what we want to highlight here is the beginning of all of this. In 1991, a research paper discussed A cryptographically secured chain of blocks for the first time.
In 1998 a computer scientist worked on 'Bit Gold', a decentralized digital currency.
In 2000, a theory was published on how to cryptographically secure chains of data.
2008 leading into 2009 was then the start of Bitcoin, which started the era of blockchain.
2014 was then the start of seeing uses for blockchain outside of only currency. 
Ask if there are any questions `<click>`


## Slide 6
As mentioned before, blockchain was popularized with bitcoin, and Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency - **can anyone guess what that is?** Alright, not too far off! Here's a definition. `<click>` A cryptocurrency is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it. One of the most important pieces to remember here is that there are no central authorities involved - it is _decentralized_. `<click>`

So how did it all begin? `<click>` The bitcoin.org domain name was registered on January fourth, 2008. `<click>` Later that year, on Halloween, a mysterious whitepaper appeared - it was authored by a pseudonymous person (or group of people) named Satoshi Nakamoto. This whitepaper, which was posted to a cryptography mailing list, contained the technical details involved in implementing the first ever blockchain - upon which bitcoin would be based. `<click>`

So, who was Satoshi Nakamoto? The true identity is still unknown to this day... but some people have guesses as to who it might be. `<click>`

- Hal Finney was the first receiver of a Bitcoin transaction - he is also known for tweeting "Running bitcoin" on January 10th, 2009. `<click>`
- Dorian Nakamoto, born Satoshi Nakamoto, is another suspect - but this is probably just a coincidence. `<click>`
- Another candidate is Nick Szabo `[SAA-boh]` - according to stylometric analysis, he writes in the same style as the bitcoin whitepaper, and he also published a paper on a precursor to bitcoin called "bit gold"
- It could also be a group of people - ultimately, we will probably never know! `<click>`

Regardless of Nakamoto's identity, on January 3rd, 2009, the bitcoin genesis block was created. `<click>`

## Slide 7
**Can anyone guess what a genesis block is?** Close! `<click>` The "genesis block" for a blockchain is simply the first block mined (also called block number 0). `<click>` In bitcoin, the reward for mining this block was 50 bitcoin - the equivalent of about 1.5 million dollars in 2022. `<click>` There is also a not-so-hidden message in the hexadecimal code - **can anyone see what it is?** It says "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on the brink of a second bailout" - it's referring to a headline from a newspaper article about banks. **Anyone have an idea why Nakamoto might have put this in the block?** Good idea! It could give us a hint to Nakamoto's motive... or even his identity. `<click>`

Speaking of Nakamoto's motive, what are some reasons to use blockchain? `<click>`

- A big one is trust - blockchain removes the need to trust anyone, because it's all public. `<click>`
- There is also no need to trust a central authority - this is meant to give individuals more power. `<click>`
- It also acts kind of like digital "cash" - it allows for peer-to-peer spending with no identity needed. `<click>`
- We'll get into it a bit more, but security was also a big part of it. Many early adopters were in the cryptography space – the entire technology is based on cryptography, which is a big part of security. Also, the immutability of the ledger means that all transactions will live forever, and can always be traced. `<click>`
- Its open source nature led to a focus on community-driven development – individual people, working together to create something new. It's kind of inspiring that they did this in such a grass-roots way!

So now the blockchain and bitcoin era have officially begun - what's next? `<click>`

## Slide 8
We'll go through some of the value history for Bitcoin just to see how it's changed. `<click>` in the beginning, bitcoin was virtually valueless - there were no exchanges, there was no market - it was mainly cryptography fans sending bitcoin for fun. `<click>`

## Slide 9
Then, in May 2010, history was made with the first real-world bitcoin purchase. At the time, bitcoin was worth less than a cent - and Laszlo Hanyecz `[HUN-yatz]` bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin. If he still had that bitcoin, it would have been worth around 680 million dollars in November 2021.

## Slide 10
Bitcoin grew steadily for a while, but since around 2013, the price has gone up and down a whole lot. The best word to describe the market is _volatile_ - this means it is liable to change rapidly and unpredictably. Things like financial crises, Covid-19, Elon Musk's tweets, Coinbase's operations, and other hidden factors can make the price skyrocket or plummet at a moment's notice. It may have been a good investment for a fortunate few, but it is highly unstable overall. `<click>`

## Slide 11
All that said, blockchain is much more than bitcoin now! `<click>` 2014 was the beginning of what's known as "Blockchain 2.0" – basically moving beyond the basics of a cryptocurrency. It became more widely available as a technology, and there was investment from companies like IBM and Microsoft. `<click>`

Since around then, there have been a lot of new cryptocurrencies (thousands, in fact). `<click>` One interesting one is Tether – it's what's known as a "stablecoin" – its value is meant to be tied to another currency. `<click>` And of course, there are memecoins like Dogecoin – which has had some ups and downs. `<click>` There is also Ether (Ethereum's cryptocurrency) – Ethereum is actually a platform upon which applications can be built using smart contracts. These are called dapps. `<click>`

Dapps are decentralized applications. Instead of back-end code running on a central server, it runs on the blockchain. Dapps have features like data integrity due to the immutable nature of the blockchain, privacy, anonymity, security, and built-in payments using Ether. They are often things like token swaps, games, and investments. `<click>`

Speaking of token swaps, another technology powered by blockchain is NFTs. These are non-fungible tokens - basically, that means that each one is completely unique. It's a way to own something digitally. As an analogy, anyone can buy a Picasso print, but only one person can own the original. In NFT world, anyone might be able to download a jpeg - but only one person can actually own the NFT. They are kind of like digital trading cards, but only one of each card exists. They could potentially be used to verify ownership or creatorship of art or music - they could help prevent plagiarism. They could also be used for things like car titles or house deeds. At this point, however, they are still in the early phases - and they are sometimes used for scams because most of their value is entirely speculative - it's not tied to any physical real-world asset. `<click>`

One final example here – Hyland Credentials is Hyland's blockchain-backed credentialing technology. The government of Malta is a customer – they used this technology to issue education certificates across the country. Falsified student transcripts were an issue they were facing, and this product helped to automate the verification process.

These are only a few examples - blockchain can also be used in things like supply chain management, food contamination tracking, and more. This is just scratching the surface! `<click>`

## Slide 15
Now we've talked about the origins of blockchain, and how it's been used - next, let's get into how the technology actually works. `<click>`

## Slide 16
Let's first cover some of the key elements. These concepts are crucial to understanding blockchain. `<click>`

A blockchain is a ledger – put simply, a place to keep track of transactions. Ledgers have existed since before computers as a way to keep balances on accounts. Blockchain ledgers are immutable, meaning the records stay around forever. They are also distributed, meaning there are multiple copies across a network. Additionally, they are secured by cryptography. Now let's talk a bit more about these transactions. `<click>`

Transactions are transfers of assets between addresses. Just like when you buy something at a store – that's a transaction! At a grocery store, they keep a record in their company files. On blockchain, it's there for all to access. These transactions are stored on _blocks_. What are blocks? `<click>`

Blocks contain groups of transactions. They are chained together, with each block storing an identifier for the previous block. They are verified, or signed, using a cryptographic function to ensure they are secure. There is a network that keeps track of all the blocks. Let's talk a bit more about that. `<click>`

The network is distributed, meaning every node (computer) on the network has a copy of the blockchain. These nodes use a consensus algorithm to determine the source of truth!

## Slide 18
Now let's get a little deeper. **Raise your hand if you've heard of crypto mining.** Okay, interesting. Sounds like some of you might want to get rich. **Does anyone know how it actually works?** Yeah, that's part of it! `<click>` Basically, a crypto miner is the one who actually creates and signs the block - they receive the Block reward, which is some amount of cryptocurrency. They can also get part of the transaction fees. But here's a question - **why would someone _believe_ a miner when they sign a block and say it's good to go?** `<click>` One method is called Proof of Work - basically, the miner has to prove that they did a bunch of computational work. `<click>` The key here is that faking this work should be extremely hard - in fact, it should be just as easy to do the work as it would be to fake it. The fun part is that validating that the work was done is super easy. All of this together helps build consensus across the network - other nodes know that they can trust this block, at least tentatively. **But how do they prove they did all this work?** Interesting ideas. `<click>` In reality, each miner is looking for a magic number called a nonce. This number is extremely hard to find. `<click>` We won't get too deep into it, but the magic number makes the _block hash_ fit a specific pattern. **Does anyone know what a cryptographic hash function is?** `<click>` It is from the world of cryptography, and is often used in security. It puts the _crypto_ in _cryptocurrency_! This function takes some data (e.g., blockchain block) and outputs a string of letters and numbers called a hash. It looks random – but it's not! The hash is always the same for a given input. `<click>` The hash has to fall under a specific pattern – for example, in bitcoin, it has to start with a bunch of 0s. `<click>` For this to happen randomly would be a 1 in 75 sextillion chance – but it's easy to verify a correct hash for the block. So, you would have to get _extremely_ lucky to strike it rich mining bitcoin, unless you had some pretty hefty mining equipment.

Now, it's okay if this doesn't make a ton of sense yet - let's get into the interactive demo to play around with it a bit.

## Slide 19
Alright, everybody should go to _this URL_: [andersbrownworth.com/blockchain](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/). This is a fun site that lets you explore some blockchain concepts in their simplest form. `<go to the site, and make sure students pull it up as well>`

To get started, let's click on "Hash" in the upper right. `<click on Hash>`

Here's where we can see the cryptographic hash function in action. The data is in the big text area, and the hash is automatically generated based on that. Everyone try typing in a message like "Blockchain is fun" to see what happens. `<enter "Blockchain is fun" in the Data field>` The hash output looks pretty random, but if you type this in exactly, you should get the exact same result! It should be "e2ea7" etc based on the input data. Try changing one letter - the hash should change completely! `<change one letter in the Data field>` Feel free to enter any message. But how does this fit in with blockchain? Next, let's click on the "Block" option from the upper right. `<click on Block>`

Now there are a couple more fields - there is a _Block Number_ and a _Nonce_. Also, notice that the _Hash_ starts with four zeroes - this means that the block is properly validated! Try entering something in the data field. `<enter "Hello" in the Data field>` Note how the background turns red - that's because the hash has been invalidated! It no longer starts with four zeroes. You may now also notice the _Mine_ button - try clicking it to see what happens! `<click the Mine button>` After a few seconds, the value in the _Nonce_ field has changed, the hash starts with four zeroes, and the background is green again! The _Mine_ button searched through some possible nonces, and found the one that made the whole hash of the block change to a valid one. Now, in a real blockchain, mining would take much longer than this - this is just a simplified example. Next, let's see what this looks like in a chain. Click on the "Blockchain" option in the upper right. `<click on Blockchain>`

Now there are multiple blocks! Each block also has a _Prev_ field - this points to the hash of the previous block. Note that changing some text on Block number 2 will not only invalidate the current block, but all the blocks after it too! `<enter "message" in the Data field of Block #2>` It then becomes necessary to re-mine each block to validate the whole chain. `<click the Mine button on Block #2, #3>` This is part of how blockchains become immutable - it's too much work to change something in the past, because it would destroy the whole chain! You might still be thinking, well, we could just re-mine everything... but the fact that the blockchain is _distributed_ makes that very difficult. Let's take a look: click on the "Distributed" option in the upper right. `<click on Distributed>`

Now there are multiple copies of the blockchain stored by multiple peers! `<enter "bogus" in the Data field of Peer C Block #5>` If one peer has a modified, bogus block, even if it is properly re-mined, the other peers won't match! From here, the network depends on the majority of nodes continuing on with the proper blocks, verified by the majority. But right about now, you might be asking yourself, where is the money? Let's see. Click on the "Tokens" option in the upper right. `<click on Tokens>`

Now, this is basically exactly the same as before - but the _Data_ field is replaced by a few different fields. It's really just a different format. Changing any letter or number will still invalidate the chain. `<change any letter or number>` But what's still missing? **Can anyone see what's wrong here?** No one? Here's a question - where does the currency actually originate? On Block 1, it looks like Darcy gave Bingley 25 dollars, but where did Darcy get that money? Let's see. Click on the "Coinbase" option in the upper right. `<click on Coinbase>`

Here, the miner of the block actually gets the block reward. They can then use that balance in any future transactions on future blocks. Here, Anders gets 100 dollars, and he can then send it to other individuals. Once those individuals have a balance, they can send it to more people. All of this is tracked and verified based on the immutability of the blockchain. Pretty cool! Again, this is a very simplified example, but hopefully it gives you an idea of how things work. There are videos and additional demos as well if you want to explore more. `<click on Blockchain Demo>`

But for now, let's get back into the PowerPoint. `<switch back to PowerPoint>`

## Slide 20
We're going to keep it a little technical and talk about Ethereum and smart contracts - this is what developers use to create blockchain-based apps. `<click>`

## Slide 21
So what is Ethereum? It is an open-source blockchain, and its currency is called Ether, also ETH or its symbol here. The difference between Ethereum and bitcoin is that Ethereum goes beyond cryptocurrency... it is fully programmable. Developers can build on top of it and create dapps. Things like decentralized finance applications, NFT applications like the metaverse, token swaps, or games like CryptoKitties. So how do developers build these apps? `<click>`

## Slide 22
First let's take a step back. **Can anyone tell me what a contract is?** Not a smart contract, just a regular one. Alright, not a bad definition. Simply put, contracts are _agreements_ between two parties - they are intended to be enforceable by law. `<click>`

Now, smart contracts are a little different – they are programs that run on blockchain under specific circumstances. `<click>`

The execute automatically. `<click>` This is kind of like when you put a coin in a vending machine and receive a snack - there is a mechanical contract built into the machine to make sure you get what you buy. `<click>` The key is that they are predictable, because anyone can see the code, they are unambiguous, because they lead to the same result every time, and they are cheap; there are no mental transactions or time loss. All of these things are quite different from normal contracts in law! `<click>`

These contracts are written in Solidity: the programming language Ethereum developers use to write smart contracts. The basics are quite similar to JavaScript if you've ever seen that before. `<click>`

One important note is that in the world of Ethereum, every transaction on the blockchain, or, every smart contract execution, costs gas – this is a small ETH fee for running anything. That said, it's still much cheaper than hiring a lawyer to execute your contract for you! `<click>`

## Slide 23
Alright, that was a lot of technical stuff - let's talk more about how blockchain impacts society, and some of the controversies that have arisen. `<click>`

## Slide 24
One big one is crime - **Does anyone know of any crimes that have happened because of blockchain?** There have definitely been a few! `<click>`

- One is a _51% attack_: if an organization could get control of 51% of the mining capabilities of a cryptocurrency, they could control it completely. Now, it is very unlikely for this to happen in bitcoin or Ethereum because it would require SO MUCH POWER, but it can happen on smaller cryptocurrencies. `<click>`
- Another thing that can happen is a _rug pull_ – when someone hypes up digital assets, like NFTS, gets people to spend money on them, and then the value goes way down. This happened with NBA player De'Aaron Fox (aka swipa the fox) – he promised big things, made 1.5 million dollars, and then swiped it all. `<click>`
- Another thing that can happen is a phishing attack – a lot of members of the bored ape yacht club have fallen victim to this. Basically, they lost "hundreds of thousands of dollars" worth of NFTs after someone hacked their Discord and posted fake links, getting them to enter their credentials. Note that this isn't a lack of security on the blockchain itself, but rather a lack of security around Discord and individuals. `<click>`
- **Anyone have an idea how anonymity might impact the transactions on blockchains?** Yeah, interesting. `<click>`
- Unfortunately, there is a decent amount of illegal activity – in 2021, about 14 billion dollars were sent to illicit addresses. The anonymity also makes it very difficult to catch criminals or hackers – no one even knows who founded bitcoin, how can they find out who stole some money on it? `<click>`
- Now on the flip side, everything on the blockchain is transparent and auditable. `<click>` This means that it is always possible to track assets – and all transactions can be traced by address. `<click>`
- In fact, in one instance, the US DOJ was able to track the group that stole money from Colonial Pipeline in a ransomware attack – they actually found their private key and hacked them back!

So crime does happen, but there are some tradeoffs to using the technology. Let's move onto another controversy. `<click>`

## Slide 25
You may have heard about bitcoin's effect on the environment - many people are upset by this. `<click>`

In fact, Bitcoin's price fell drastically when Elon Musk announced that Tesla would no longer accept it for purchases - and that decision was made because of its negative impact on the environment. `<click>` Mozilla stopped taking donations for the same reason.

**But does anyone know how much energy bitcoin really uses?** Good guesses... `<click>` it actually consumes almost 120 TerraWatt hours per year. `<click>` That's about the same amount of energy as a small country like Sweden. All of Sweden! That's got to be bad for the environment! However... `<click>`

While this energy consumption _is_ undeniably bad for the environment, the real issue is how we get that energy. Carbon emissions really occur when we harvest energy, not when electrical energy is used. `<click>` And, there are efforts to improve this – for example, some companies are using renewable energy (like Texas solar plants) to mine crypto. One idea is to utilize the excess energy on a network to mine crypto, and sell it to monetize creation of the electrical grid. They could turn off mining when the network needs the energy, and try to normalize the network load. `<click>` There are also technological changes that can take place – like using different consensus algorithms. For example, Ethereum is moving from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake – we won't get into the details, but proof-of-stake requires much less computational intensity, and therefore less energy.

So, blockchain definitely has an effect on the environment... but there are a lot of other factors as well. Let's move onto the final controversy we will discuss. `<click>`

## Slide 26
Let's start by taking a look at this tweet. `<click>` "Proud dad tweet. Taught my three-year-old about investing this morning. He could either have half a gummy prior to nursery or he could leave it there and have two in the afternoon. He chose the latter. So proud! I ate them both once he left though because hashtag volatility." **Does anyone remember what _volatile_ means?** Yeah that's right! `<click>` When something is volatile, that means it is liable to change rapidly and unpredictably. That's where we get the phrase crypto-bubble. Similar to the dot com bubble, or tulip mania - the idea is that these speculative assets are actually worthless, and it's all fabricated hype that can crash at any moment. `<click>` In fact, Wikipedia stopped taking donations in the form of cryptocurrency, calling it "extremely risky" and "inherently predatory" – this is just one example to show that this is a real issue. `<click>` Part of the reason this is the case is that the crypto market is unregulated. **Can anyone tell me why lack of government regulation could be a good thing? Or maybe a bad thing?** Alright, interesting ideas! `<click>` Now, all of that in consideration, let's take a look at this thing called the Gartner Hype Cycle - it's designed to show visibility of emerging technologies over time. It starts with the technology trigger, then goes up to the peak of inflated expectations, then down to the trough of disillusionment, then up through the slope of enlightenment, and finally, levels out at the plateau of productivity. Lots of technologies have followed this pattern. **Does anyone have a guess where blockchain might be at this point in time?** Good thoughts! `<click>` Ultimately, the big takeaway here is that the technology of blockchain is _more than just cryptocurrency_ - it may not be a good idea to invest all your savings in bitcoin, but learning about new technologies like this is always a good thing to do. The best place to invest is in your knowledge. Proponents of blockchain say that the technology is not going away; it will be leveraged in the infrastructure layers of global computing into the far reaches of the future. That may or may not be true, but it never hurts to be informed on it. `<click>`

## Slide 27
Alright! That's about it for the presentation. Let's sum up some of what we covered. `<click>`

## Slide 28
We'll start with the history. `<click>` Blockchain all started with Bitcoin in 2009, but many use cases have arisen since then including NFTs and certifications. `<click>` In its basic form, a blockchain is a digital ledger that tracks transactions on blocks, chained together and verified by a network of computers called nodes. `<click>` Ethereum is a specific blockchain platform that allows developers to build dapps using smart contracts. `<click>` There have been, and continue to be, several controversies surrounding the technology – but learning about it is never a bad thing.

**Does anyone have any other key takeaways from the presentation?** Nice!

## Slide 29
**Any questions?** Alright! Thank you.

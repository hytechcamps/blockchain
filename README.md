# Building Blocks of Blockchain
The goal of this camp is to demystify blockchain and the various programs built on top of it. Students will learn about the relationships between blockchain, cryptocurrency, NFTs, and other applications of the technology. Ultimately, students should come away from this camp with a better idea of what blockchain actually is, and how it can be applied to real-world problems.

### Videos
There are videos for the lecture and follow-along activity [here](https://app.sharebase.com/#/folder/1617179/share/3-mKxT63FxJIuobuk0TwpdJxuupJA).

- **LectureVideo.mp4** - this video goes through the lecture as if there were students present
  - Review [the presentation](Blockchain.pptx)
  - Review the [script](LectureScript.md)
- **FollowAlongPart1.mp4** - this video walks through the first half of the follow-along activity as if there were students present
  - 0:00-5:29 - Setup, Remix Demo
  - 5:29-19:06 - Using the Song NFT Deployment
  - 19:06-24:01 - (OPTIONAL) Song NFT: More Deployment Functions
- **FollowAlongPart2.mp4** - this video walks through the second half of the follow-along activity as if there were students present
  - 0:00-4:47 - Song NFT: Adding an Artist Field
  - 4:47-12:08 - (OPTIONAL) Song NFT: Adding More Requirements
  - 12:08-15:24 - Self-Paced Work Overview

## Icebreaker
Go around the room (in-person and/or virtual) and have each student introduce themselves. They should say their name, school, and grade - they can then answer one of the following questions:

- What would you do with a million dollars?
- What is your dream job?
- What is your dream vacation destination?
- What is your favorite movie/tv show?

In addition, ask each student what they know about blockchain.

## Lecture - PowerPoint
Present the [PowerPoint Presentation](Blockchain.pptx). There are notes in the slides - make sure to keep it interactive and ask the students questions throughout. There is a video and a [script](LectureScript.md) for the presentation.

## Formative Assessment - Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/62a0fa2f78f3c51ef02f8371). You must create a Blooket account in order to host the game. There is a "Crypto Hack" game that is thematically relevant to the camp material, so that is the recommended option to select when hosting. For this camp, it may be a good idea to spend a bit more time on the formative assessment - maybe about 15 minutes.

## Follow-Along - Smart Contract
Walk through the [follow-along activity](FollowAlong.md) as a group. **Make sure to emphasize that the students do not need to understand the code;** it's more about the deployed contract. There are some code updates to make, but it is not worth taking the time to explain the technical programming details. There are videos walking through this activity.

## Self-Paced Work - Further Exploration
If there is any time remaining for self-paced work, have the students follow the [self-paced work instructions](SelfPacedWork.md). Instruct them to go to [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozomies.io) and work through the interactive Solidity tutorial. It's quite advanced, so there is no expectation that they will understand it - but if they skip through, they can see some of the resulting app features from the code.

Alternatively, if there is interest, play Blooket again for the remainder of the time before giving the students the survey.

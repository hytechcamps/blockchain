# Building Blocks of Blockchain
The goal of this camp is to demystify blockchain and the various programs built on top of it. Students will learn about the relationships between blockchain, cryptocurrency, NFTs, and other applications of the technology. Ultimately, students should come away from this camp with a better idea of what blockchain actually is, and how it can be applied to real-world problems.

## Icebreaker
Go around the room (in-person and/or virtual) and have each student introduce themselves. They should say their name, school, and grade - they can then answer one of the following questions:

- What would you do with a million dollars?
- What is your dream job?
- What is your dream vacation destination?
- What is your favorite movie/tv show?

In addition, ask each student what they know about blockchain.

## Lecture - PowerPoint
Present the [PowerPoint Presentation](Blockchain.pptx). There are notes in the slides - make sure to keep it interactive and ask the students questions throughout. There is also one interactive activity around consensus - follow the notes in the slides to properly facilitate that activity.

## Formative Assessment - Blooket
Facilitate the [Blooket quiz](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/62a0fa2f78f3c51ef02f8371). You must create a Blooket account in order to host the game. There is a "Crypto Hack" game that is thematically relevant to the camp material, so that is the recommended option to select when hosting. For this camp, it may be a good idea to spend a bit more time on the formative assessment - maybe about 15 minutes.

## Follow-Along - Smart Contract
Walk through the [follow-along activity](FollowAlong.md) as a group.
